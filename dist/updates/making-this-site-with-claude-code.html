        <h1>Making this site with Claude Code</h1>

<h2>Why</h2>

<ul><ul><li>I feel I'm being left behind by all this AI hype.</li></ul></ul>
<p>-</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>

<h3>1. Made a thorough set of instructions</h3>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<h3>Imagemagick resize</h3>

<p>Imagemagick script was failing. Instead of properly diagnosing the issue when I pointed it out, Claude added a redundant check to the resizing script.</p>

<p>I got around this by manually generating a test command and comparing that to what Claude was invoking. It became clear that claude was appending an extraneous ">" character in the resize option:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>const command = `magick "${sourcePath}" -resize ${maxWidth}x${maxHeight}> -quality ${quality} "${destPath}"`;</p>
<p>```</p>

<p>When I pointed that out to Claude, it strangely added an escape sequence `-resize ${maxWidth}x${maxHeight}\\>`:</p>
<p>!<a href=""./claude-resize-escape-wut.png"">Escape sequence wut</a></p>

<h3>Vertical centering icons</h3>

<p>I asked the agent to add arrow-key driven navigation to the photo gallery. Amazingly it added a working version with minimal prompting. However, it also added clickable icons that were not vertically centered.</p>

<p>It's a good reminder that Claude Code can't "see" the page and make aesthetic judgements. Pixel pushing is Claude is a rough feedback cycle and you're better off diving into the codebase for this sort of tweak.</p>
