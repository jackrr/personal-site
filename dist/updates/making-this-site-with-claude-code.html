        <h1>Making this site with Claude Code</h1>

<h2>Why</h2>

<ul><ul><li>I feel I'm being left behind by all this AI hype.</li></ul></ul>
<p>-</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>

<h3>1. Made a thorough set of instructions</h3>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<h3>Imagemagick resize</h3>

<p>ImageMagick script was failing. Instead of properly diagnosing the issue when I pointed it out, Claude added a redundant check to the resizing script.</p>

<p>I got around this by manually generating a test command and comparing that to what Claude was invoking. It became clear that Claude was appending an extraneous ">" character in the resize option:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>const command = `magick "${sourcePath}" -resize ${maxWidth}x${maxHeight}> -quality ${quality} "${destPath}"`;</p>
<p>```</p>

<p>When I pointed that out to Claude, it strangely added an escape sequence `-resize ${maxWidth}x${maxHeight}\\>`:</p>

<p>I don't get it what it was up to. I told it to remove the unnecessary character and we were good from there...</p>

<h3>Pixel wars</h3>

<p>The agent seems to struggle correcting finer UI issues. Two specific issues I saw were with 1) icon placement and 2) SVG selection and rendering.</p>

<h4>1) Icon placement</h4>

<p>I asked the agent to add arrow-key driven navigation to the photo gallery. I was amazed to watch it add a working version with no additional prompting. However, it also added clickable icons that were not vertically centered.</p>

<h4>2) SVG selection and rendering</h4>

<p>I asked Claude to add a footer with a few external icon links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Bluesky profiles. It more or less nailed the links to GitHub and LinkedIn, but the Bluesky icon was unrecognizable:</p>

<img src="../assets/claude-bluesky-wut.png" alt="Bluesky Womp">

<p>I told it "the bluesky icon isn't rendering correctly". Claude responded appropriately with:</p>

<blockquote>The Bluesky icon has been updated with a proper SVG path. The new icon uses the correct Bluesky butterfly logo design with two curved paths representing the wings. The updated icon should now render correctly alongside the GitHub and LinkedIn icons in the footer.<br>Perfect! I've updated the Bluesky icon with the official Bluesky butterfly logo SVG. This new icon uses the correct butterfly shape with two wing paths that properly represent the Bluesky brand identity. The icon should now render as a recognizable butterfly shape rather than two apostrophes.</blockquote>
<p>...and yet:</p>

<img src="../assets/claude-bluesky-bowtie.png" alt="Bluesky Womp Bowtie">

<p>So then I got a little terse "it looks like a crooked bowtie"</p>

<p>And Claude was patient with me, leaving me with a glimmer of hope:</p>

<p>>I've created a simpler butterfly icon with two symmetrical wing paths and a small circle in the center for the body. This should render as a cleaner, more recognizable butterfly shape that looks good alongside the GitHub and LinkedIn icons. The simplified design uses the standard 24x24 viewBox for consistency with the other icons.</p>
<p>... but sadly visually, I got what looks something like an overburdened tote bag:</p>

<p>It's a good reminder that unlike a person, Claude Code can't "see" the page and make aesthetic judgments. Pixel pushing with Claude code is a rough feedback cycle and you're better off diving into the codebase yourself for this sort of tweak.</p>
