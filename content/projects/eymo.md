# Eymo

![Eymo Module](./eymo.html)

Ey(e)mo(uth) is a program that does fun things with a video stream of a face.

This project uses WebGPU, which is not fully supported across all web browsers and operating systems. If the above module does not work on your system you may be able to get it working by enabling WebGPU in your browser via a feature flag. See [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/webgpu) for instructions specific to your setup.

Check out the [GitHub](https://github.com/jackrr/eymo) for more info, including instructions for desktop installation and more details on the configuration language.

Stay tuned for a "how it's made" series of blog posts that dig into various components of the implementation.
