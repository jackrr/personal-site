# About this site

All content (text, images) on this site are of my own making and are not to be copied without my express permission.

The code backing this site (html, css, js) was generated with AI. See [my post on how it was made](/updates/making-this-site-with-claude-code) for more info.

Higher resolution images are available for printing if that's your thing. I'm not trying to make money here, just keep some amount of control of my stuff.
