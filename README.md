# Personal Site

A static personal website built with TypeScript and Bun, featuring a blog, projects showcase, and photo galleries.

Most of this project is AI generated by Claude Code, except:
- [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/jackrr/personal-site/blob/main/AGENTS.md) - the prompt to generate this project
- [`./content`](https://github.com/jackrr/personal-site/tree/main/content) - my source images, markdown blog posts, and page contents

You can thank Claude for the rest of this file...

## Build Process Overview

The site uses a custom static site generator implemented in TypeScript (`build.ts`) that:

1. **Content Processing**: Reads markdown files from the `./content/` directory
   - `content/homepage.md` → Homepage at `/`
   - `content/blog/*.md` → Blog posts at `/updates/:post-name`
   - `content/projects/*.md` → Project pages at `/projects/:project-name`
   - `content/photos/*` → Photo galleries at `/photos/:gallery-name` (when available)

2. **Markdown Parsing**: Custom lightweight markdown parser that converts:
   - Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
   - Bold/italic text (`**bold**`, `*italic*`)
   - Links (`[text](url)`)
   - Lists (bulleted and numbered)

3. **HTML Generation**: Creates responsive HTML pages with:
   - Consistent navigation header
   - Dark/light theme support
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - High contrast accessibility

4. **Asset Generation**:
   - `styles.css` - Responsive CSS with CSS variables for theming
   - `script.js` - Theme toggle functionality with localStorage persistence

## Photo Galleries

The site includes a powerful photo gallery system:

### Processing Photos
```bash
# Basic usage
bun run process-photos ~/Photos/vacation-2024 vacation-2024

# With custom dimensions and quality
bun run process-photos ~/Photos/event my-event 800 600 75
```

### Features
- **Automatic resizing**: Images resized to web-friendly dimensions (default: 1200x800px)
- **Quality optimization**: JPEG quality optimization (default: 85%)
- **Smart copying**: Only JPEG files are processed, other files ignored
- **Original preservation**: Source files are never modified
- **ImageMagick integration**: Automatic detection and use of ImageMagick for resizing
- **Fallback support**: Graceful fallback to copying without resize if ImageMagick unavailable

### Gallery Structure
- Gallery index at `/photos` shows all available galleries
- Individual galleries at `/photos/<gallery-name>` with responsive grid layout  
- Mobile-optimized viewing with lazy loading
- Hover effects and smooth image scaling
- Consistent theme integration with dark/light mode support
